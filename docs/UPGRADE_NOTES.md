# Upgrade Notes

Only key upgrade points are written here. To view the change log, please visit the [release page](https://github.com/yeojz/metalsmith-react-templates/releases)

## v7.0.0

-   Support for react-router v4 (which is not backward compatible)
-   `jsx-render-engine` is also available as a separate package published from this repository

## v6.0.0

-   Support for other rendering strategies (Preact, React Router)
-   Deprecated `noConflict` and `propKeys` in favor of `templateKey` and `props`

## v5.0.0

-   The `html` option has been dropped. In replacement `extensions` has been defaulted to `.html`.
-   `propKeys` option has been tweaked.
    -   It now accepts an array of keys to pick
    -   Giving a string key would return `{key: value}` instead of just the `value`.

## v4.1.2

-   Support for React 15 is implicit. i.e. No change in code base. Which explains the patch version bump.

## v3.1.5

-   Babel and react are now peer dependencies
-   For `babel 6`, additional [plugin](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins) packages are needed for it to run properly

## v3.0.0

-   From this version, this plugin will only use `babel` as it's transpiler as `react-tools` will be deprecated from `0.14` onwards.
